I recently found out about a nice browser extension called [**hola**][hola].
If you cannot checkout sites like [hulu.com][hulu], [netflix.com][netflix],
[cbs.com][cbs] (yes, watch The Mentalist :D), [spotify.com][spotify]
and so on because you're not from the US, than you will.

[Hola][hola] gives you a VPN with IP from US/UK or whatever country IP you
need. It's easy to setup and free.

Have fun.
