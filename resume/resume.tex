    % About
    \section{About}

I'm excited about low-level programming and backend-oriented opportunities. I've got 5 years Python experience as a full stack developer and 1.5 years C++ experience as a TA in university and an interest in open source, c(pp), python, linux, rock climbing and chess. Check \href{http://andreipetre.ro}{my website} for a list of open source contributions. I'm also a member of \href{http://rosedu.org}{ROSEdu}, an organization that promotes open-source in education.

\section{Experience}

% SDE1 - Jan 2019 - March 2021
% SDE2 - April 2021 - present
\textbf{Software Developer Engineer}, \href{https://aws.amazon.com/}{AWS RDS}, Bucharest, Romania\hfill March 2022 - Present\\
\textbf{Software Developer Engineer}, \href{https://aws.amazon.com/}{AWS RDS}, Vancouver, BC\hfill Jan 2019 - Feb 2022 \\
\href{https://aws.amazon.com/rds/}{Amazon Relational Database Service} (Amazon RDS) makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while automating time-consuming administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching and backups. It frees you to focus on your applications so you can give them the fast performance, high availability, security and compatibility they need.

\textbf{Software Engineer}, \href{http://upbeatpr.com}{UpbeatPR} (prev. Crowdbooster), Bucharest\hfill Dec 2015 - March 2018\\
\textbf{Software Engineer Intern}, \href{http://crowdbooster.com/}{Crowdbooster.com}, San Francisco, CA\hfill Feb 2015 - Aug 2015\\
Highly targeted pitching process, enabled through our amounts of data we collected about\\ journalists -- PR without relationships.
\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt  % reduce space between items
	\item One of the first engineers at Upbeat, designed and built systems core to our business in Python, Django, Scrapy, Celery, ElasticSearch, Javascript (ES6), React, Redux and Ruby on Rails
    \item Worked on all parts of delivering software: design, implementation, testing, deployment, continuous integration, maintenance, instrumentation and monitoring.
	\item Worked remotely \nicefrac{2}{3} of my time at Upbeat, but, in spite of that, was able to become an asset to the team, helping my colleagues grow through well-thought and in-depth code reviews. Maintainer of our scraping system and of our data quality efforts.
\end{itemize}\vspace{-2.5mm}
\textbf{Selected accomplishments}
\begin{itemize} \itemsep -2pt  % reduce space between items
	\item Implemented an indexing system using ElasticSearch, that powered an internal search engine that our PR agents used to pitch journalists - our primary business driver. We've indexed \bettertilde16M articles in ElasticSearch.
	\item Designed and built a cost-effective FeedPoller system that had daily volume of \bettertilde650K new urls per day from 20K feeds we had in our db. It was able to poll the feeds efficiently, each worker could handle hundreds of urls over a few seconds, doing asynchronous requests with a combination of gevent and celery. The system could easily scale horizontally.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Software Engineer}, \href{http://devlabel.com/}{dev.Label}\hfill Aug 2014 - Jan 2015\\
Full stack developer, used Groovy, Javascript, Coffeescript and ChromeDriver for working on \href{https://www.trade.it/}{trade.it}, a multi-broker trading application, while in its early development stage.
