I didn't have a mouse once for at least 5-6 hours and had to do some work which included gmail.
You would be surprised how easy shortcuts are if you try them out.

* first [enable shortcuts][gmail-enable-shortcuts]: click right top gear ->
select *Settings*, then in *General* tab scroll a bit and select
*Keyboard shortcuts on*.

* the most common shortcuts I use are:

Shift + ? - checkout the table with all shortcuts
k - when you are viewing an email, go to the next newer email (up)
j - when you are viewing an email, go to the next older email (down)
